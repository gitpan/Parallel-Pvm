1.3.0
-----
2001-11-16  Denis Leconte

	* Patched in pvm_start_pvmd() support, code developed and
          provided by Benjamin Holzman.

2001-09-20  Ulrich Pfeifer  <upf@de.uu.net>

	* Pvm.xs: Fixed memory leak in config(), tasks() and hostsync().

2001-04-10  Florian Frank   <flori@neopoly.de>

	* Pvm.xs: Added endtask() function.

2001-02-24  Ulrich Pfeifer  <upf@de.uu.net>

	* Pvm.xs: Removal of the remaining hand crafted prototypes changed the
	signatures for mcast, pack, addhosts, and delhosts from "@" to ";@".
	I am not sure if there is any difference, but I trust the generated
	ones more :-)

	* Pvm.xs: Removed obsolete stuff for 1:1 functions.  Only difference in
	generated code is that hostsync() now has a prototype.  I assume it
	was forgotten originally and keep it.  Also mkbuf had a wrong 
	prototype of "$" instead of ";$".  This is why one should leaf this to 
	programs ;-)

2001-02-23  Ulrich Pfeifer  <upf@de.uu.net>

	* Pvm.pm: Added code2symbol and code2text to have error texts
	availbale for debugging.

	* Pvm.xs: Added PROTOTYPES: to the group section.

	* Pvm.pm: Added my name to the AUTHORS section.  Removed spurious
	hint about the 100k limit. Documented new group functions.

	* t/group.t: Fixed number of tests.

	* Pvm.xs, t/group.t: Added pvm_gsize.

	* Pvm.xs, t/group.t: Added pvm_getinst and pvm_gettid.

	* Pvm.xs, t/group.t: Group functions except pvm_reduce done.

	* Pvm.xs, t/group.t: Added some more group functions with
	rudimentary tests.

2001-02-22  Ulrich Pfeifer  <pfeifer@wait.de>

	* Pvm.xs, t/group.t: Removed pvm_prefix

	* Makefile.PL, Pvm.xs, t/group.t: First groups function works.

	* Pvm.xs: removed the ifdef Stuff.  Short enough now.

	* Pvm.xs:
	Removed useless switch in constant().  The stuff is still too bulky.

	* Pvm.pm: Fixed(?) the prototype for autoloaded functions.

	* t/bigmsg.t: Test spawns to processes with different tids now

	* Pvm.xs: Fixed of by one bug at string end.

	* MANIFEST: Removed test.pl, added t/bigmsg.t

2001-02-21  Ulrich Pfeifer  <pfeifer@wait.de>

	* t/bigmsg.t: Waiting seems not to be the problem

	* t/bigmsg.t: Must wait for listener to come up.

	* t/bigmsg.t, test.pl: Tests start working.

	* t/bigmsg.t: Added crude test for big message delivery.

	* Pvm.xs: Fixed header

	* Pvm.xs: Added some checks for return values.

	* Pvm.pm: Fixed typos

	* Pvm.xs: Accidentally removed initialization re-added.

	* Pvm.pm: Documented signature changes.

	* Pvm.xs: Seems to work

	* Pvm.xs: precv: Added third optional argument "buflen".

	* Pvm.xs: Removed buffer_string

	* Makefile.PL: Make this work on my Linux box.

Old revision history for Perl extension Pvm.

1.2.1 to 1.2.2
---------------
Fix segfault in tasks() if there is an error.
Get rid of string_type to avoid integer overflow problems.
unpack() and precv() interpret everything as a string, like pack().
Thanks to Sven Neuhaus <sn@neopoly.com> for the patch!

1.2 to 1.2.1
----------
Debug for proper compilation under Perl 5.6.0.
Thanks to Florian Frank <flori@neopoly.de>
for the patch.
Denis P. Leconte


1.0 to 1.2
----------
Reimplement in a new xs shell so it will compile
and test OK on Perl 5.0005 
Denis P. Leconte


1.0 to 1.1
----------
1, Parallel::Pvm::spawn now accepts argv argument

2, Parallel::Pvm::notify accepts "cnt" argument
   for PvmHostAdd

3, Parallel::Pvm::recv_notify correctly receives
   list of host tids for PvmHostAdd notification

4, Some internal buffering optimization.
