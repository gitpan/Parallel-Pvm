PERL-PVM
--------

This is a perl extension for the parallel virtual machine
(PVM) message-passing system.   Before you begin installation
you must have already installed PVM (the most recent version of
PVM may be found at http://www.csm.ornl.gov/pvm/).

You must also set the environment variables

        setenv PVM_ROOT <pvm root directory>
        setenv PVM_ARCH `$PVM_ROOT/lib/pvmgetarch`

For a correct installation you will also need perl5.005
or greater.

Once all the preliminaries have been done, the installation
sequence is as follows:

        tar xvf Parallel-Pvm-1.4.0.tar
        cd Parallel-Pvm-1.4.0

Have a look into Makefile.PL to see if you have to make any
changes.  Afterwhich do

        perl5 Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

Please read the man page, ie.

        perldoc Parallel::Pvm

Any questions, critisims or suggestions are welcome.
