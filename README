	PERL-PVM
        --------

This is a perl extension for the parallel virtual machine 
(PVM) message-passing system.   Before you begin installation
you must have already installed PVM (the most recent version of 
PVM may be found at http://www.epm.ornl.gov/pvm).  

You must also set the environment variables 
	
	setenv PVM_ROOT <pvm root directory>
	setenv PVM_ARCH `$PVM_ROOT/lib/pvmgetarch`

For a correct installation you will also need perl5.002 
or greater.

Once all the preliminaries have been done, the installation 
sequence is as follows:

	tar xvf Parallel-Pvm-1.1.tar 
	cd Parallel-Pvm-1.1

Have a look into Makefile.PL to see if you have to make any 
changes.  Afterwhich do 

	perl5 Makefile.PL
	make 
	make test
	make install

Please read the man page, ie.

	perldoc Parallel::Pvm

Any questions, critisims or suggestions are welcome.
