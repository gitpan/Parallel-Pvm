1.3.0 is a completely user-contributed release! 

Large parts of Parallel::Pvm were rewritten by Ulrich Pfeifer,
while preserving the original API. (And a great job he did!)
- unpack() now accepts an extra parameter for the size of the
  message, removing the previous 100.000 char limit.
- The pvm group functions are now implemented.
- Memory leaks in the config(), tasks() and hostsync() functions 
  were fixed.
- There is now also a very nice setup for test scripts - they
  reside in the "t" directory. 
This work was sponsored by Neopoly AG.

Benjamin Holzman contributed support for the pmv_start_pvmd()
API call.

PERL-PVM
--------

This is a perl extension for the parallel virtual machine
(PVM) message-passing system.   Before you begin installation
you must have already installed PVM (the most recent version of
PVM may be found at http://www.csm.ornl.gov/pvm/).

You must also set the environment variables

        setenv PVM_ROOT <pvm root directory>
        setenv PVM_ARCH `$PVM_ROOT/lib/pvmgetarch`

For a correct installation you will also need perl5.005
or greater.

Once all the preliminaries have been done, the installation
sequence is as follows:

        tar xvf Parallel-Pvm-1.3.0.tar
        cd Parallel-Pvm-1.3.0

Have a look into Makefile.PL to see if you have to make any
changes.  Afterwhich do

        perl5 Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

Please read the man page, ie.

        perldoc Parallel::Pvm

Any questions, critisims or suggestions are welcome.
